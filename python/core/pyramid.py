  For a given image shape, computes the number of levels in a multiresolution

  E.g., for a shape of (128, 64, 3), a factor of 2 and a minimum resolution of
  8, the function will return 4, corresponding to the following pyramid levels:

    level 0: (128, 64, 3),

  """Represents an image as multiresolution Laplacian pyramid of images.

  This class represents an image as a stack of images of increasing
  resolution. The original image is recovered by successive upscaling + addition
  of the data in a bottom-up manner. This representation is overparameterized,
  with more degrees of freedom than pixels. This is fine, as the multiscale
  hierarchy means the lower resolution levels get optimized more quickly. This
  representation is used as a preconditioner for gradient descent on image data
  (e.g., textures).

  The class supports nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation, and also
  supports clamping to a valid range, which limits the values during
  optimization to a physical range."
